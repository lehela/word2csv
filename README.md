# Word2CSV Converter

Copy following items into a local folder:

    - file:         word2csv.bat
    - directory:   word2csv

In your local folder, drag & drop one or more ".docx" files onto the "word2csv.bat" file.

A command window opens and ask to confirm the output path for the converted CSV files (the chosen path will be remembered)

The program will show a progress bar for each file while it is converted.

At the end the command line window will close after a few seconds automatically.
