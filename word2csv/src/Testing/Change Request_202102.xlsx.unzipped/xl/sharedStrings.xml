Currently, the team has bypassed this error but including this 0000199999 assignment code as a "others" channel in our channel mapping table.

•Deloitte has setup three AWS environments for a POC at own cost for Income's Cloudera version in order to integrate it with Kafka for various scenarios.
•Deloitte installed &amp; configured Kafka Cluster in all of INCOME’s environments DEV, QAS &amp; PRD.
•Deloitte integrated Kafka to Informatica in all environments.
•Deloitte integrated Kafka to Power Exchange in all environments.
•Deloitte has performed preparation task, installation, Integration &amp; configuration to enable CDC from Source Systems</t></si><si><t>•Kafka options research
•Pre/Post Installation in DEV, QAS &amp; PRD environments
•Installation of Power Exchange on the server &amp; client tool (VDI)
•Installation of Developer Tools
•Installation of Kafka
•Integration with all Source Systems
•Configuration &amp; Sanity test of each Software Component
•Design, Build, Unit Test, SIT
•Documentation &amp; UAT Support</t></si><si><t>Deloitte had to pick kafka to fill a product gap of Informatica DEI. Unlike power center Informatica DEI can't do CDC on its own and needs kafka in between.</t></si><si><t>Vendor/ System</t></si><si><t>Define Sizing logic</t></si><si><t>Gathering Sizing Inputs</t></si><si><t>Coordinating with vendors</t></si><si><t>SAP Data Hub</t></si><si><t>N</t></si><si><t>Y</t></si><si><t>SAP S4HANA</t></si><si><t>Talend</t></si><si><t>Informatica</t></si><si><t>Cloudera</t></si><si><t>File Server</t></si><si><t>N/A</t></si><si><t>SoW Ref</t></si><si><t>Summary</t></si><si><t>Chapter</t></si><si><t>Chapter Name</t></si><si><t>SOW Excerpt</t></si><si><t>3.3.A</t></si><si><t>Data Cleansing limited to validity, consistency, and uniformity</t></si><si><t>Project and Functional Scope</t></si><si><t>If required, extracted data is cleansed ensuring validity, consistency, and uniformity of IFRS17 relevant data.</t></si><si><t>3.3.B</t></si><si><t>CDC defined as timestamp based delta extracts</t></si><si><t>Data is extracted from source systems as full loads, or as delta loads where possible (CDC).

Further, Income's homegrown systems are having complex interactions between systems which are not easy to understand. Hence, current estimates now assume ~4.5md per table for data conversion which is an increase of 1.5md over the workbench assumption.</t></si><si><t>-</t></si><si><t>Data Modelling</t></si><si><t>FPSL requires core FRS117 Logic implemented before its model can be filled. Current design to implement FRS117 logic requires modelling one Generic Business Model to harmonize source system data, and one FRS117 model to hold the results of FRS117 logic flows. We're assuming ~12 data entities @ 10 md per entity to design, build, and test these models.</t></si><si><t>Not considered</t></si><si><t>SAP FPSL TVE Interface</t></si><si><t>SAP confirmed in Apr 2020 it only accepts undiscounted FCF to calculate changes over time. Therefore, ETL now needs to do these calculations, and "side inject" the results into the later TVE stage for FPSL to calculate CSM. There are 15 processes to design, build, test, etc. @15md each.</t></si><si><t>FRS117 Logic</t></si><si><t>Checked</t></si><si><t>TBC</t></si><si><t>Data Gap</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 712108</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 706969</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662689</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662690</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662705</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662706</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662707</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662708</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662709</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662711</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662710</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 702319</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 702320</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 702576</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 703001</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 703301</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 703520</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 712162</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 705458</t></si><si><t>PMC CR 662692 (CR3B)</t></si><si><t>Income Approval</t></si><si><t>Approved to Bill</t></si><si><t>Informatica EDC &amp; DEQ Sanity Test repetition with the new Cloudera UAT</t></si><si><t>Status</t></si><si><t>Not Started</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 712122</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 712123</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 712600</t></si><si><t>Change in requirement</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 705271</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 708420</t></si><si><t>PMC Issue 705272</t></si><si><t>Workaround</t></si><si><t>2nd FPSL upgrade from 1812 SP03 to SP04 - service pack release to cater for functionl gaps.
